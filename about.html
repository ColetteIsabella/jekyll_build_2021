  <h2>Colette Isabella (She/they)</h2>
  <h3>Is an odd bee.</h3>
  <img class="me" src="/assets/withhorns.jpg">
  <p>Raised in a house by a book enthusiast and computer engineer, there was no way she would grow up without some ideas and how to use them. She was born and raised in Colorado, where she discovered a love for bees, art and science.</p>
  <p>She became a Master Beekeeper while in high school, and fell in love with the work and the fuzzy insects. She pursued her first degree in Anthropology, find the study fascinating, but incomplete. After the traditional backpacking jaunt through Europe, she returned to pursue a degree in Molecular Biology.</p>
  <p>Eventually, she moved to Seattle and now lives with her part kitten, part dog, all Water-Cat</p> <h3>Dame Emily Thrith</h3>

  <p>In 2017, she finally got to realize her passion of keeping her own bees, and her first Apprentice at the Center for Urban Horticulture.</p>
  <p>Since moving to Seattle, she took over The Seattle Attic Community Workshop, a feminist Maker Space, where she got to play with Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, and 3D Printers while supporting a safe space for lgbtqia and minority people could interact and learn together. She started working Conventions, and found the thread that has been connecting her whole life, heart work.</p>
  <p>She now is finishing her Masters in Clinical Psychology because for all the other attempts at "normalcy", her ideal life is one working to help others. Her focus is on opening minds and hearts for some, and helping to maintain love for those who have been so pushed to close up. </p>
  <p>This has all been an extraordinarily up and down life, which seems the only kind she knows, it makes fodder for her constant story collecting and learning how to better be a better person and friend.</p>
