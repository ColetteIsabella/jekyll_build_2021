  <h3> Colette has been a Master Beekeeper since she was in high school. She currently works predominantly as a consultant and Wandering Master for anyone curious, excited or interested in bees. When the world comes back, we can't wait to see you at presentations around Seattle, especially the West Seattle Bee Festival which is a favorite. </h3>

  <h2>In August 2018, I gave a talk for teh Puget Sound Beekeepers Association on the anatomy and organization of bees. I spent weeks meticulously researching and drawing out these pieces. I have layers of all the levels, especially the Drone, which I feel was my Master piece.</h2>
  <img src ="/assets/000_worker.png">
  <p>The Worker is the most well known of the bees you see. These are the bees that do all the work to maintain the hive. Nurses, Foragers, Builders, these are the little ones that make the hive function under direction of their queen.</p>
  <img src ="/assets/000_w_anatomy.png">
  <p>The Anatomy of the Workers is almost identical to the Queen except for the atrophed ovaries. They are even genetically the same, but they cannot ever become queens. Without a queen directing them by pheromone, they will try to become queens, but can never produce viable offspring.</p>
  <img src ="/assets/001_queen.png">
  <p>The Queen is bigger than the Worker, this is drawn as a Mated Queen. Virgin Queens have slightly shorter abdomens, but after mating, they take this form, require only one mating flight to lay thousands of eggs through out their lives.</p>
  <img src ="/assets/001_queen_anatomy.png">
  <p>Inside, Queens are set up almost entirely for their jobs as Mother to thousands of bees. The only difference between her form and her Workers is the fact that in her larval form, she was given Royal Jelly, a high nutrient and sugar formula, which changed her genetic expression.</p>

  <p>Poor Drones are so easily ignored, but they are so so important and so so sweet.</p>
  <img src ="/assets/002_d_anatomy_all.png">
  <p>Finding good examples of Drone Anatomy is Super difficult, so I put this together from bits all over the internet, in books and disections. </p>

  <p>A highlight of this amazing organ feels important. The Drone's inverted penis will only come out in flight with a Queen, the force of its ejaculation is so intense, it discharges the whole organ from the drone's body, creating a "Pop" Audible to humans nearby. It then falls backwards, making room for other Drones to deposit their genetic material, and falls to the ground to die from a job well done. </p>

  <p>Bee brains are so beautiful and complex! They are affected by the same chemicals as ours, but magnified for the size. Bees communicate with pheromones, with dance, they remember complicated directions, and teach others what they know. These little things should Never be underestimated.</p>

  <h2>Since drone bees do not have stingers, when I am teaching a class or find a Hitchhiker, they are ideal for petting and introducing to nervous bee-friends</h2>
  <h3>This is Arthur, they got caught in my bee suit, and came home with me, so to keep them safe from my cats, they wore a leash when they were not in their jar.</h3>

  <h3>This is Dave, they were our introductory friend at our first class at the hives. A little water on their wings, and they were a perfect gentlebee.</h3>
