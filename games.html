    <h2>This is a storytelling game, still under construction, based on the phenomenal work "The Virga Series" by Carl Schroeder.</h2>
    <h1>Lost in Candesce</h1>
    <p>Our system is vast, composed of such variation and strangeness. We live within a great bubble, designed by our ancestors to protect us from their own creations. Hundreds of years ago, they created a force, a result of the Singularity, automata with great power and complication, began to challenge our right to exist in the same universe. An agreement was made, and many chose to remain, and trust these new beings, but our ancestors knew better, they knew that eventually, the Children of the Singularity would turn, as is the style of all beings when they find a lesser life form in their way.</p>
    <p>The stories of how we came here have passed into legend, and for many, the CTS have become a tall tale to frighten children from venturing too close to the outer wall or to do their chores.</p>
    <p>"Clean your room, or I'll replace you with a CTS!"</p>
    <p>So where are we? We are the humans who survived, we formed small planetoids within the great bubble. We are surrounded by breathable air, but each planetoid has a unique set of rules, based on its size and distance from a human made sun. The greatest source of life, and light, is Candesce. It was built first, and contains within it a jammer which serves to seal our bubble from the CTS, but in that, it also blocks all radio and electronic waves so that all higher technology does not function. Navigation between lands is done by visual cues, and complicated maps which change constantly, based on the slow movement of bodies set adrift. One day an orb of ocean, teeming with life could float between your land and you neighbor's but a few months later, there they are, and the ocean has migrated on.</p>
    <p>The ability to build suns is a closely guarded secret, held by the highest class of builders, and passed on one builder to the next. Pirate suns have been created on a few occasions, by necessity, smaller than Candesce, but it becomes a source of great power for the surrounding lands, where their entire eco system changes with the new light and gravitational adjustments.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, to the day, a disaster occurred. Somehow, Candesce was briefly turned off, jammer and all. Rumors of Invaders getting through the barrier surfaced, but with slow communication and some still not believing in the past, it has remained rumor.</p>
    <p>Besides, once Candesce came back on, they would have been destroyed, right? We are members of a cluster known as Lower Candesce. We share the light of the great sun of suns, but the great powers of Virga, who rule all the system, have degned us our own cluster to rule with relatively little interference. The Metrix, living on the land closest to the sun, and whose ancestors managed to trap an ocean orb, is the figurehead of the cluster. With their great resources, they are able to partition out supplies as needed, and they are known as undisputed, though in part because they have never directly intervened on the lesser Houses.</p>
    <p>This event which you are attending, invited specifically by the Scribe of Lower Candesce for two great purposes:</p>
    <p>One, it is the 32nd birthday of the Metrix, twice the age of adulthood, and the tradition is to hold a gala event with nobles from throughout their region.</p>
    <p>The second event is three years exactly since the outage of Candesce.</p>
    <p>So you arrive, by ship to their home, with a foreboding over this auspicious occasion. You will want to present in your finest, to show the wonders of your land, and the significance of your status. Tonight is to show the Metrix, as they take their place as arbiter of the system, supreme judge in the land, and hope that you will never have to see their dreaded face.</p>
  <br/>

    <p>You will notice that all pronouns are they, this is because we are a well wizened society, and find the strict use of pronouns more limiting. In the production of your character, if you feel a pronoin best fits their construction, you are certainly welcome to add it. Additionally, if you have another pronoun specification, something you feel fits your character better than the limits of English, that is welcome as well, weave it into the culture of your people, and it will be required that the party recognize your definitions.</p>
    <p>Their majesty the Metrix Cloughburn has considered the samples provided of your scent, and has assigned a character name and position for you, but they recognize, that for the evening it is your story as well. In pursuit of this, I will be sending along the outlines for a play book so that you may begin the design of your character. Consider your planet, your culture. Are you from a larger or smaller land? Is it closer or further from the Sun? What are your chief exports? What are your house colors? How does your house choose who takes the governorship? Do you want the status you have, or do you wish for another life?</p>
    <p>Additionally, as all the members of the party present, and become clear, an overview of each shall be conveyed to you, and you shall choose:</p>

    <br/><p>One to harbor a secret interest in, either romantically, socially or economically.</p> <p>One to hold a deep resentment or distrust for.</p>
    <p>And one to trust implicitly.</p>
    <p>As we go forward, I beg you continue to hold the secret of your invitation. At present, the structure of the night shall go as follows:
5pm: guests begin to arrive.
At 9:30 shall be a grand presentation, before which, you shall be playing your part.
At that time, as well, if you have particular Gentry you wish to come by as the play shall be over, and we may allow unknowns to cavort amongst our ranks. I must humbly request, that you:
Check with your humble scribe before inviting others, and that the participate in at least some level of finery.
They are not required to have a character, but their majesty the Metrix plans to pursue the evening in it's entirety, which requires a level of decorum.
Each character shall be given a mask upon arriving, which we will design based on your character as they are formed.
And as your servant, I most humbly request that no perfumes or colognes be worn this night. The Metrix is most sensitive, and would enjoy the fullness of their senses for this occasion.

Most graciously yours,
Scribe to the Metrix themself,
